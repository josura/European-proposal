2. methodology
Describe methodology, concepts, models and assumptions with the objectives in mind. the framework should be implemented like a spring framework, some skeleton code should be generated with a metamodel blueprint. The devices in the decentralized system should use some form of common API interface to communicate and be quick in these communications. The AI models provided should combine both a decentralized and centralized methodology to process data quickly, and these models should be dynamically changing and improving based on the interactions of users(so the operation of prediction, training, improving should all be online and for streams of data). To obtain high performance and good results for streams of data, and models.

Devices as agents, the decision support framework is distributed, decentralized, connected with other agents, and dynamic (always improving with input).

A diagram like sequence diagrams, workflow diagrams for the WP and tasks and a lot of everything.

- european projects
  - [https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/876967](Big data pRocessing and Artificial Intelligence at the Network Edge  **BRAINE**)
    - **Abstract** Thanks to its multiple technical advantages, edge computing is capable of considerably boosting services and applications. It can do this by supporting AI natively instead of relying on the cloud. The EU-funded BRAINE project aims to further the development of edge computing by focusing on energy-efficient hardware and AI software that can process Big Data at the edge and support security, data privacy and sovereignty. To achieve its goal, it will build a seamless edge microdata centre interlinked with AI-enabled network interface cards. Through its work, the project will advance Europe’s position in intelligent edge computing and promote growth in sectors such as smart manufacturing, the Internet of Things, smart cities and smart healthcare.
    - **objectives** Edge computing offers many technical advantages, e.g. reduced latency, secure decentralized processing and storage, scalability at lower complexity, versatility to adapt the changes in resources and applications, and increased reliability. Edge computing can dramatically boost services and applications by supporting artificial intelligence (AI) natively, instead of relying on the cloud. Edge computing supporting AI is the only technology that will enable many of the long-awaited game changers: Industry4.0 and smart manufacturing, 5G, IoT, self-driving vehicles, remote robotics for healthcare, and machine vision among others.The BRAINE project’s overall aim is to boost the development of the Edge framework focusing on energy efficient hardware and AI empowered software, capable of processing Big Data at the Edge, supporting security, data privacy, and sovereignty. The approach is to build a seamless Edge MicroDataCenter interlinked with AI enabled network interface cards. BRAINE employs a visionary utilization method for edge resources management and network-edge workload distribution. Predicting resource availability and workload demand, identifying trends, and taking proactive actions are all aspects of these novel methods.The impact of BRAINE encompasses advances in the European video distribution ecosystem, improving data processing at the network edge, and proving integrated AI for applications. These will lead to unprecedented savings in performance and energy efficiency: 2x performance/Watt and 50% energy savings; 71% latency reduction for an acceleration centric EMDC; 80% space and maintenance reduction, 99.999% fault tolerance with level 5 autonomy (autonomous driving, robotics, mission-critical system); and significantly faster infrastructure installation and deployment. BRAINE boosts EU’s position in the intelligent edge computing field and enables growth across many sectors, e.g. manufacturing, smart healthcare, surveillance, satellite navigation.

compare the methodologies with the ones used for non-european projects and european projects as well, not getting too much into details since the methodology will be presented in the next section.

1. objectives
2. methodology
Describe methodology, concepts, models and assumptions with the objectives in mind. the framework should be implemented like a spring framework, some skeleton code should be generated with a metamodel blueprint. The devices in the decentralized system should use some form of common API interface to communicate and be quick in these communications. The AI models provided should combine both a decentralized and centralized methodology to process data quickly, and these models should be dynamically changing and improving based on the interactions of users(so the operation of prediction, training, improving should all be online and for streams of data). To obtain high performance and good results for streams of data, and models.

Devices as agents, the decision support framework is distributed, decentralized, connected with other agents, and dynamic (always improving with input).

A diagram like sequence diagrams, workflow diagrams for the WP and tasks and a lot of everything.

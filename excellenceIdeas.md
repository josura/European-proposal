2. methodology
Describe methodology, concepts, models and assumptions with the objectives in mind. the framework should be implemented like a spring framework, some skeleton code should be generated with a metamodel blueprint. The devices in the decentralized system should use some form of common API interface to communicate and be quick in these communications. The AI models provided should combine both a decentralized and centralized methodology to process data quickly, and these models should be dynamically changing and improving based on the interactions of users(so the operation of prediction, training, improving should all be online and for streams of data). To obtain high performance and good results for streams of data, and models.

Devices as agents, the decision support framework is distributed, decentralized, connected with other agents, and dynamic (always improving with input).

    - **Abstract** Thanks to its multiple technical advantages, edge computing is capable of considerably boosting services and applications. It can do this by supporting AI natively instead of relying on the cloud. The EU-funded BRAINE project aims to further the development of edge computing by focusing on energy-efficient hardware and AI software that can process Big Data at the edge and support security, data privacy and sovereignty. To achieve its goal, it will build a seamless edge microdata centre interlinked with AI-enabled network interface cards. Through its work, the project will advance Europe’s position in intelligent edge computing and promote growth in sectors such as smart manufacturing, the Internet of Things, smart cities and smart healthcare.
    - **objectives** Edge computing offers many technical advantages, e.g. reduced latency, secure decentralized processing and storage, scalability at lower complexity, versatility to adapt the changes in resources and applications, and increased reliability. Edge computing can dramatically boost services and applications by supporting artificial intelligence (AI) natively, instead of relying on the cloud. Edge computing supporting AI is the only technology that will enable many of the long-awaited game changers: Industry4.0 and smart manufacturing, 5G, IoT, self-driving vehicles, remote robotics for healthcare, and machine vision among others.The BRAINE project’s overall aim is to boost the development of the Edge framework focusing on energy efficient hardware and AI empowered software, capable of processing Big Data at the Edge, supporting security, data privacy, and sovereignty. The approach is to build a seamless Edge MicroDataCenter interlinked with AI enabled network interface cards. BRAINE employs a visionary utilization method for edge resources management and network-edge workload distribution. Predicting resource availability and workload demand, identifying trends, and taking proactive actions are all aspects of these novel methods.The impact of BRAINE encompasses advances in the European video distribution ecosystem, improving data processing at the network edge, and proving integrated AI for applications. These will lead to unprecedented savings in performance and energy efficiency: 2x performance/Watt and 50% energy savings; 71% latency reduction for an acceleration centric EMDC; 80% space and maintenance reduction, 99.999% fault tolerance with level 5 autonomy (autonomous driving, robotics, mission-critical system); and significantly faster infrastructure installation and deployment. BRAINE boosts EU’s position in the intelligent edge computing field and enables growth across many sectors, e.g. manufacturing, smart healthcare, surveillance, satellite navigation.
    - **comparision** IDIoHMA will also use common devices to do edge computing and keep energy efficency really high since the decision support system will act especially on edge devices that are already being used for other things (smartphones, smartwatch, smartcity devices), the final implementation will be used directly on these devices in a mesh-network where devices with the same goal contribute to the final objectives (to support something in one or more decisions). IDIoHMA has the common objective of promoting growth in the IoT environment and provide an adaptable interface to situations where there is a need for a decision support system.

    - **Abstract**In every disaster and crisis, incident time is the enemy, and getting accurate information about the scope, extent, and impact of the disaster is critical to creating and orchestrating an effective disaster response and recovery effort. The main goal of beAWARE is to provide support in all the phases of an emergency incident. More specifically, we propose an integrated solution to support forecasting, early warnings, transmission and routing of the emergency data, aggregated analysis of multimodal data and management the coordination between the first responders and the authorities. Our intention is to rely on platforms, theories and methodologies that are already used for disaster forecasting and management and add the elements that are necessary to make them working efficiently and in harm under the same objective. The overall context for beAWARE lies in the domain of situational awareness and command and control (C2). The first phase concerns the forecast of the extreme condition and the relevant preparations. Once a disaster occurs, an initial assessment needs to be conducted as soon as possible to determine the scope, geographical distribution, and scale of the incident. Situational awareness means being able to accurately determine what has happened, what is happening now, and what will come next, all in order to plan and coordinate the most effective response possible with the resources available. This observation phase will lead to an orientation phase suggesting both an individual as well as collective “cognition” orientation to data that is sensed and communicated. Once orientation to the data (or the lack of it) occurs then a decision is made, ultimately resulting is the final step, which is “act”. The crisis management center is always striving or struggling to gain a sense of what is reality to be able to feel that he or she can make a decision that is the ""best possible"" given the circumstances.
    - **objectives** Getting accurate information about the scope, extent and impact of the disaster is critical to creating and orchestrating an effective disaster response and recovery effort. The main goal of beAWARE is to provide support in all the phases of an emergency incident.” The beAWARE knowledge base is the semantic foundation that provides the classification scheme and deduction rules and also analyses information and distributes outcomes. Information is obtained from local citizens, first responders, social media, local weather forecasts, sensors such as in situ static cameras to monitor water levels and even cameras on drones.  Citizens and first responders communicate with the beAWARE platform via the beAWARE mobile application. The social media monitoring module searches for and validates related social media content and then analyses it to perform spatiotemporal grouping of relevant posts.  The smart algorithms analyse both visual and audio information. As Dr Karakostas explains, “the visual analysis module can define the type of crisis, detect relevant objects (for example, cars in a flooded area) and estimate the traffic.” An automated speech recognition module transcribes audio messages received through the beAWARE mobile app or phone calls in four languages (English, Greek, Italian and Spanish).  “The Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) is beAWARE’s central command and control system,” Dr Karakostas notes. “It receives information from citizens, first responders and social media, processes it through automatic reasoning engines and analytics services and generates automatic incident reports or enriches field reports with information based on multimedia, social media and sensor analytics.” Two field pilots validated the beAWARE platform: a heatwave simulation in Greece, and a flood simulation in the Italian Eastern Alps region. During the flood test, the mayor as decision-maker was supported by various offices of the municipality and region to staff the control room and act as first responders.

2. methodology
Describe methodology, concepts, models and assumptions with the objectives in mind. the framework should be implemented like a spring framework, some skeleton code should be generated with a metamodel blueprint. The devices in the decentralized system should use some form of common API interface to communicate and be quick in these communications. The AI models provided should combine both a decentralized and centralized methodology to process data quickly, and these models should be dynamically changing and improving based on the interactions of users(so the operation of prediction, training, improving should all be online and for streams of data). To obtain high performance and good results for streams of data, and models.

Devices as agents, the decision support framework is distributed, decentralized, connected with other agents, and dynamic (always improving with input).

  - [Big data pRocessing and Artificial Intelligence at the Network Edge BRAINE](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/876967)
    - **Abstract** Thanks to its multiple technical advantages, edge computing is capable of considerably boosting services and applications. It can do this by supporting AI natively instead of relying on the cloud. The EU-funded BRAINE project aims to further the development of edge computing by focusing on energy-efficient hardware and AI software that can process Big Data at the edge and support security, data privacy and sovereignty. To achieve its goal, it will build a seamless edge microdata centre interlinked with AI-enabled network interface cards. Through its work, the project will advance Europe’s position in intelligent edge computing and promote growth in sectors such as smart manufacturing, the Internet of Things, smart cities and smart healthcare.
    - **objectives** Edge computing offers many technical advantages, e.g. reduced latency, secure decentralized processing and storage, scalability at lower complexity, versatility to adapt the changes in resources and applications, and increased reliability. Edge computing can dramatically boost services and applications by supporting artificial intelligence (AI) natively, instead of relying on the cloud. Edge computing supporting AI is the only technology that will enable many of the long-awaited game changers: Industry4.0 and smart manufacturing, 5G, IoT, self-driving vehicles, remote robotics for healthcare, and machine vision among others.The BRAINE project’s overall aim is to boost the development of the Edge framework focusing on energy efficient hardware and AI empowered software, capable of processing Big Data at the Edge, supporting security, data privacy, and sovereignty. The approach is to build a seamless Edge MicroDataCenter interlinked with AI enabled network interface cards. BRAINE employs a visionary utilization method for edge resources management and network-edge workload distribution. Predicting resource availability and workload demand, identifying trends, and taking proactive actions are all aspects of these novel methods.The impact of BRAINE encompasses advances in the European video distribution ecosystem, improving data processing at the network edge, and proving integrated AI for applications. These will lead to unprecedented savings in performance and energy efficiency: 2x performance/Watt and 50% energy savings; 71% latency reduction for an acceleration centric EMDC; 80% space and maintenance reduction, 99.999% fault tolerance with level 5 autonomy (autonomous driving, robotics, mission-critical system); and significantly faster infrastructure installation and deployment. BRAINE boosts EU’s position in the intelligent edge computing field and enables growth across many sectors, e.g. manufacturing, smart healthcare, surveillance, satellite navigation.
    - **comparision** IDIoHMA will also use common devices to do edge computing and keep energy efficency really high since the decision support system will act especially on edge devices that are already being used for other things (smartphones, smartwatch, smartcity devices), the final implementation will be used directly on these devices in a mesh-network where devices with the same goal contribute to the final objectives (to support something in one or more decisions). IDIoHMA has the common objective of promoting growth in the IoT environment and provide an adaptable interface to situations where there is a need for a decision support system. 
  - [Enhancing decision support and management services in extreme weather climate events](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/700475)
    - **Abstract**In every disaster and crisis, incident time is the enemy, and getting accurate information about the scope, extent, and impact of the disaster is critical to creating and orchestrating an effective disaster response and recovery effort. The main goal of beAWARE is to provide support in all the phases of an emergency incident. More specifically, we propose an integrated solution to support forecasting, early warnings, transmission and routing of the emergency data, aggregated analysis of multimodal data and management the coordination between the first responders and the authorities. Our intention is to rely on platforms, theories and methodologies that are already used for disaster forecasting and management and add the elements that are necessary to make them working efficiently and in harm under the same objective. The overall context for beAWARE lies in the domain of situational awareness and command and control (C2). The first phase concerns the forecast of the extreme condition and the relevant preparations. Once a disaster occurs, an initial assessment needs to be conducted as soon as possible to determine the scope, geographical distribution, and scale of the incident. Situational awareness means being able to accurately determine what has happened, what is happening now, and what will come next, all in order to plan and coordinate the most effective response possible with the resources available. This observation phase will lead to an orientation phase suggesting both an individual as well as collective “cognition” orientation to data that is sensed and communicated. Once orientation to the data (or the lack of it) occurs then a decision is made, ultimately resulting is the final step, which is “act”. The crisis management center is always striving or struggling to gain a sense of what is reality to be able to feel that he or she can make a decision that is the ""best possible"" given the circumstances.
    - **objectives** Getting accurate information about the scope, extent and impact of the disaster is critical to creating and orchestrating an effective disaster response and recovery effort. The main goal of beAWARE is to provide support in all the phases of an emergency incident.” The beAWARE knowledge base is the semantic foundation that provides the classification scheme and deduction rules and also analyses information and distributes outcomes. Information is obtained from local citizens, first responders, social media, local weather forecasts, sensors such as in situ static cameras to monitor water levels and even cameras on drones.  Citizens and first responders communicate with the beAWARE platform via the beAWARE mobile application. The social media monitoring module searches for and validates related social media content and then analyses it to perform spatiotemporal grouping of relevant posts.  The smart algorithms analyse both visual and audio information. As Dr Karakostas explains, “the visual analysis module can define the type of crisis, detect relevant objects (for example, cars in a flooded area) and estimate the traffic.” An automated speech recognition module transcribes audio messages received through the beAWARE mobile app or phone calls in four languages (English, Greek, Italian and Spanish).  “The Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) is beAWARE’s central command and control system,” Dr Karakostas notes. “It receives information from citizens, first responders and social media, processes it through automatic reasoning engines and analytics services and generates automatic incident reports or enriches field reports with information based on multimedia, social media and sensor analytics.” Two field pilots validated the beAWARE platform: a heatwave simulation in Greece, and a flood simulation in the Italian Eastern Alps region. During the flood test, the mayor as decision-maker was supported by various offices of the municipality and region to staff the control room and act as first responders.
    - **comparision**: the whole project of beAWARE is about the creation and orchestration of effective disaster response and recovery efforts and to provide support to all the phases of an emergency. The details of the project are specifically for the case of emergency cases, while IDIoHMA focus is toward the creation of the software and the methodologies to use for the decision support system in a decentralized and collaborative environment. Since the aim of beAWARE needs to be really focused on the task of security and trustworthy decisions to mantain the wellbeing of the citizens, the project dedicate a lot of resources to account for the measures and the reliability of the decisions taken. IDIoHMA, on the other hand, is a framework that is used to create an hybrid decision support system that relies on a decentralized network of devices that work in the same environment or are an interface to other environments that have the same functions and work on the coordination and orchestration of the these devices to create the computation network needed to build the decision model dynamically from the decision of its users, aside from that, the final product will be mainly dependent on the implementation of the developers and how they integrate the framework with what they want to achieve.
  - [Enabling Demand Response for short and real-time Efficient And Market Based smart Grid Operation - An intelligent and real-time simulation approachEnabling Demand Response for short and real-time Efficient And Market Based smart Grid Operation - An intelligent and real-time simulation approach](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/641794)
    - **Abstract**: Demand Response helps fulfil the Smart Grid potential. In practice, at the moment only a few smart grids (SGs), based on automated operations and smart metering, are up and running in Europe. The diversity of users and renewable energy resources present a very real challenge to the economic model. By focusing on consumer remuneration strategies, one EU project hopes to make SGs more attractive.
    - **objectives**: Smart Grid (SG) concepts are rapidly being transferred to the market and huge investments have been made in renewable based electricity generation and rolling out smart meters. However, the present state of the art does not ensure neither a good return of investment nor a sustainable and efficient power system. The work so far in the EU involves mainly larger stakeholders, namely power utilities and manufacturers more focused on production and grid resources. A closer attention to the demand side of the system is required, and especially in the interaction with the new methods for SG management.  Efficient power systems require the optimal use of the available resources to cope with demand requirements and Demand Response (DR) programs with adequate business models can leverage demand flexibility both on centralized and distributed models, as renewable energygeneration is highly dependable of uncontrolled factors (as wind and solar radiation) for which anticipated forecasts are hardly trustful.  DREAM-GO puts together research teams from the EU and US thus taking advantage of US experience in DR, teaming up academic partners with pioneer work in smart grid management and non-academic partners (SMEs) with the required know how and infrastructure to jointly produce relevant advancements in the state of the art. SME participation will ensure cross-fertilization of ideas and competences to build a knowledge network targeting the scientific community and other smart grid actors, as power resource managers, grid operators and resource aggregators, and ultimately targeting consumers (through consumers organisations and curtailment service providers) on the demand side. The main goal is to create a framework with the required methods and solutions to facilitate the adoption of the results in final applications, by providing grounded scientific knowledge to possible pathways for future implementation of a more efficient SG system in the EU.
    - **comparision**: IDIoHMA could be used for smart-grids, since the whole concepts is to take decision for monitoring, redirecting, handling voltages, handling sources, handling failure and a lot of other things could be implemented in IDIoHMA and some core functionalities of the project could be useful to build a smart-grid quickly, where the devices are agents related to some part of the smart grid(even hierarchical since some devices will be used to control a set of other devices, like devices related to a grid of solar panels, another device could handle the source of power from a grid of devices related to wind energy, etc.), and smart-grids in general rely a lot on the concept of taking decision alone or in a hybrid environment(especially when decisions are taken from consensus of various parts). A thing that could be done is a pilot or a use-case for smart-grids with IDIoHMA, since it is really related to the topic.   
  - [A secure and reusable Artificial Intelligence platform for Edge computing in beyond 5G Networks](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101015922)
    - **Abstract**: Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the key technologies shaping the future of the internet and the world. With a greater number of applications than ever before, significant progress has been made in the performance and accuracy of AI-based solutions. However, AI integration into decision-making systems and critical infrastructure still requires assuring end-to-end quality. The EU-funded AI@EDGE project will address these issues by introducing reusable, secure and trustworthy AI solutions in the network edge. The goal is to revolutionise communication networks in a variety of applications, including vehicles, industrial networks, aviation and in-flight entertainment, introducing the AI-for-networks and networks-for-AI paradigms. With this approach, AI@EDGE aims to positively impact industry innovation throughout Europe while shaping the future of AI.
    - **objectives**:Artificial Intelligence has become a major innovative force and it is one of the pillars of the fourth industrial revolution. This trend has been acknowledged also by the European Commission that has already pointed out how high-performance, intelligent, and secure networks are fundamental for the development and evolution of the multi-service Next Generation Internet (NGI). While great progress has been done during the last years with respect to the accuracy and performance of AI-enabled platforms, their integration in potentially autonomous decision-making systems or even critical infrastructures requires end-to-end quality assurance.  AI@EDGE addresses the challenges harnessing the concept of “reusable, secure, and trustworthy AI for network automation”. In AI@EDGE European industries, academics and innovative SMEs commit to achieve an EU-wide impact on industry-relevant aspects of the AI-for-networks and networks-for-AI paradigms in beyond 5G systems. Cooperative perception for vehicular networks, secure, multi-stakeholder AI for IIoT, aerial infrastructure inspections, and in-flight entertainment are the uses cases targeted by AI@EDGE to maximise the commercial, societal, and environmental impact.  To achieve the goal, AI@EDGE targets significant breakthroughs in two fields: (i) general-purpose frameworks for closed-loop network automation capable of supporting flexible and programmable pipelines for the creation, utilization, and adaptation of the secure, reusable, and trustworthy AI/ML models; and (ii) converged connect-compute platform for creating and managing resilient, elastic, and secure end-to-end slices capable of supporting a diverse range of AI-enabled network applications.
    - **comparision**: IDIoHMA has the objective of a true human-AI hybrid system for human empowerment, the scope of the project is not only aimed toward a decision-support system for some specific tasks, but to a framework that could also implements other things other than decision-support, like a network of devices that collect some feedback on the users and give them some aggregated and significant information about what they are doing, or some software that provides users with different measures and information (like some embeddings) that could be used by the user or the software developer to create something both for the users and for the stakeholders as well (like building clusters of users to understand their interests and habits, or understand the demand of some products). The use cases are endless and the core functionalities of IDIoHMA will provide everything to build a decentralized system for human empowerment. **TODO** talk a little more about the impact and how the framework respecte the **DO NOT SIGNIFICANT HARM** principle. 

compare the methodologies with the ones used for non-european projects and european projects as well, not getting too much into details since the methodology will be presented in the next section.

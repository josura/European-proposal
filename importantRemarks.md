# Things to consider and that are really important in general
* pilots and partners
* Key Impact Pathways
* social impact and use case (test environment)
* Security assessment (mandatory)
* explainability & repeatability & Reproducibility
* Focus on an impact driven process of creation of the proposal and the process of building the infrastructure and how to satisfy the destinations and topics required by the whole programme(added to the call objectives)
* greater coordination of more calls to satisfy both the objective of the call in details, and the objectives of the topic in general(providing pilots and use cases directly on the topic, but building the framework and the theory around a general approach that could satisfy the needs of the European commission work programme in general)
* Focus and attention on stakeholders especially when considering pilots, use cases, and the objectives of the partners.

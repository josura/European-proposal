The interactions of humans and AI systems are becoming a cornerstone of research and digital innovation not only in ICT, but also in any field that needs a digital interface to be used to its full potential. With the growing population of smart devices and the IoT, along with the interconnection of multiple devices in a network via the Continuum Cloud-to-edge, and the 6G wireless communication technologies, the world is evolving into a smart world fully connected and aimed toward the collaboration of humans and machines powered by AI, and where complexity rises along the amount of functionalities and interactions that humans have with their creation, and where complexity rises along the amount of functionalities and interactions that humans have with their creation, as well as the techno-dependency for this products. 
All these phenomena lead to a grater quantity consequences that need to be taken into account when designing the architecture and the interconnection substructure  TODO
